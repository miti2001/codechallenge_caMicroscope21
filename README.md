## Chat Application
I have created a two-way chat app that allows users to chat in real-time across different discussion groups. It uses the Node.js and express frameworks and socket.io library. User-Interface is elevated with the use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

## Running the app
```bash
npm init
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```
## Notes
You can run a demo of the app on heroku
